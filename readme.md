# toDo/toLearn

<small><code>**A Project** to gather them all, **A Project** to list them all, **A Project** to learn them all, and in the code finish them.</code></small>

This project is for keeping all your projects in one place, and to keep track of what you have learned and what you want to learn. You can add project to do and skills to learn, put them time limits, and keep track of your progress by updating the status.

This project is a work in progress, and I am still working on it. I am using it to learn and practice new technologies and tools. The backend is done with Node.js, Express and Prisma, and the frontend with native HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
